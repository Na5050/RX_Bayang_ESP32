# RX Bayang nRF24L01
Thanks to the original developers "goebish" and "bikemike" https://github.com/bikemike/nrf24_multipro/tree/rx_mode.
#
Includes 4x servo and 4x logic outputs.

This RC receiver works with RC transmitters [OpenAVRc](https://github.com/stanekTM/OpenAVRc_Dev) or [Multiprotocol](https://github.com/stanekTM/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module) from my fork.

Note: I use (Arduino) ATmega328P 5V/16Mhz and supply VCC only with 3.3V voltage. 
I haven't tried the 3.3V/8Mhz version yet.
#
Later I would like to add [Silverware telemetry](https://github.com/silver13/BoldClash-BWHOOP-B-03).
If you have already added the telemetry, feel free to contact me.
