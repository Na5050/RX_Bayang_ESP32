# RX_Bayang_Servo
Thanks to the original developers "goebish" and "bikemike" https://github.com/bikemike/nrf24_multipro/tree/rx_mode.

Includes 4x servo and 4x logic outputs.

Later I would like to add [Silverware telemetry](https://github.com/silver13/BoldClash-BWHOOP-B-03).
If you have already added the telemetry, feel free to contact me.
