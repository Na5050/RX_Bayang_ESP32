# RC receiver with "Bayang" protocol
This RC receiver works with RC transmitters [**OpenAVRc**](https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev) or [**Multiprotocol**](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module).

Includes 4x servo output and 4x logic outputs.
#
Later I would like to add telemetry.
If you have already added the telemetry, feel free to contact me.

Thanks to the original developers "goebish", "bikemike" and many others ... https://github.com/bikemike/nrf24_multipro/tree/rx_mode.
