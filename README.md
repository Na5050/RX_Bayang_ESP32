# RX Bayang nRF24L01
Thanks to the original developers "goebish", "bikemike" and many others ... https://github.com/bikemike/nrf24_multipro/tree/rx_mode.
#
This RC receiver works with RC transmitters [**OpenAVRc**](https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev) in RF SPI mode or [**Multiprotocol**](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module) in serial mode.

Includes 4x servo output and 4x logic outputs.

Note: I use (Arduino) ATmega328P 5V/16Mhz and supply VCC only with 3.3V voltage.
#
Later I would like to add telemetry.
If you have already added the telemetry, feel free to contact me.
